# pw-memory-card-game

This is a simple memory card game that I created as my first project for General Assembly's SE Immersive program. 

# Technologies Used
This Memory Card Game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML was used to structure the content of the web page, CSS was used to style the game and make it visually appealing, and JavaScript was used to add interactivity and functionality to the game.

# Getting started
The game is available at this link: https://phoebewalquist.github.io/pw-memory-card-game/
To play the game, simply click on two cards to flip them over. If the cards match, they will stay face-up. If they don't match, they will flip back over and you'll need to try again.
Keep playing until you've matched all the colors on the board. Good luck!

# Planned Future Enhancements
Here are some future enhancements that I plan to implement in this memory game:

Sound Effects:I plan to add sound effects to the game to make it more immersive. For example, I would add a sound effect when the player flips a card or when they match two cards.

CSS Improvements: Continue to improve the styling of the game using CSS. I want to create a clean, modern design that enhances the user experience.

Mobile Optimization: Optimize the game for mobile devices so that it can be played on smartphones and tablets. This will involve making the game responsive and touch-friendly.
